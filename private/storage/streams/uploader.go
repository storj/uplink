// At a high level, uploads are composed of two pieces: a SegmentSource and an
// UploaderBackend. The SegmentSource is responsible for providing the UploaderBackend
// with encrypted segments to upload along with the metadata necessary to upload them,
// and the UploaderBackend is responsible for uploading the all of segments as fast and as
// reliably as possible.
//
// One main reason for this split is to create a "light upload" where a smaller client
// can be the SegmentSource, encrypting and splitting the data, and a third party server
// can be the UploaderBackend, performing the Reed-Solomon encoding and uploading the pieces
// to nodes and issuing the correct RPCs to the satellite.
//
// Concretely, the SegmentSource is implemented by the splitter package, and the
// UploaderBackend is implemented by the streamupload package. The Uploader in this package
// creates and combines those two to perform the uploads without the help of a third
// party server.
//
// The splitter package exports the Splitter type which implements SegmentSource and has
// these methods (only Next is part of the SegmentSource interface):
//
//  * Write([]byte) (int, error): the standard io.Writer interface.
//  * Finish(error): informs the splitter that no more writes are coming
//                   with a potential error if there was one.
//  * Next(context.Context) (Segment, error): blocks until enough data has been
//                                            written to know if the segment should
//                                            be inline and then returns the next
//                                            segment to upload.
//
// where the Segment type is an interface that mainly allows one to get a reader
// for the data with the `Reader() io.Reader` method and has many other methods
// for getting the metadata an UploaderBackend would need to upload the segment.
// This means the Segment is somewhat like a promise type, where not necessarily
// all of the data is available immediately, but it will be available eventually.
//
// The Next method on the SegmentSource is used by the UploaderBackend when it wants
// a new segment to upload, and the Write and Finish calls are used by the client
// providing the data to upload. The splitter.Splitter has the property that there
// is bounded write-ahead: Write calls will block until enough data has been read from
// the io.Reader returned by the Segment. This provides backpressure to the client
//  avoiding the need for large buffers.
//
// The UploaderBackend ends up calling one of UploadObject or UploadPart
// in the streamupload package. Both of those end up dispatching to the
// same logic in uploadSegments which creates and uses many smaller helper
// types with small responsibilities. The main helper types are:
//
//  * streambatcher.Batcher: Wraps the metaclient.Batch api to keep track of
//                           plain bytes uploaded and the stream id of the upload,
//                           because sometimes the stream id is not known until
//                           after a BeginObject call.
//  * batchaggregator.Aggregator: Aggregates individual metaclient.BatchItems
//                                into larger batches, lazily flushing them
//                                to reduce round trips to the satellite.
//  * segmenttracker.Tracker: Some data is only available after the final segment
//                            is uploaded, like the ETag. But, since segments can
//                            be uploaded in parallel and finish out of order, we
//                            cannot commit any segment until we are sure it is not
//                            the last segment. This type holds CommitSegment calls
//                            until it knows the ETag will be available and then
//                            flushes them when possible.
//
// The uploadSegments function simply calls Next on the SegmentSource, issuing
// any RPCs necessary to begin the segment and passes it to a provided SegmentUploader.
// multiple segments to be uploaded in parallel thanks to the SegmentUploader interface.
// It has a method to begin uploading a segment that blocks until enough resources are
// available, and returns a handle that can be Waited on that returns when the segment
// is finished uploading. The function thus calls Begin synchronously with the loop
// getting the next segment, and then calls Wait asynchronously in a goroutine. Thus,
// the function is limited on the input side by the Write calls to the source, and
// limited on the output side on the Begin call blocking for enough resources.
// Finally, when all of the segments are finished indicated by Next returning a nil
// segment, it issues some more necessary RPCs to finish off the upload, and returns the
// result.
//
// The SegmentUploader is responsible for uploading an individual segment and also has
// many smaller helper types:
//
//  * pieceupload.LimitsExchanger: This allows the segment upload to request more
//                                 nodes to upload to when some of the piece uploads
//                                 fail, making segment uploads resilient.
//  * pieceupload.Manager: Responsible for handing out pieces to upload and in charge
//                         of using the LimitsExchanger when necessary. It keeps track
//                         of which pieces have succeeded and which have failed for
//                         final inspection, ensuring enough pieces are successful for
//                         an upload and constructing a FinishSegment RPC telling the
//                         satellite which pieces were successful.
//  * pieceupload.PiecePutter: This is the interface that actually performs an individual
//                             piece upload to a single node. It will grab a piece from
//                             the Manager and attempt to upload it, looping until it is
//                             either canceled or succeeds in uploading some piece to
//                             some node, both potentially different every iteration.
//  * scheduler.Scheduler: This is how the SegmentUploader ensures that it operates
//                         within some amount of resources. At time of writing, it is
//                         a priority semaphore in the sense that each segment upload
//                         grabs a Handle that can be used to grab a Resource. The total
//                         number of Resources is limited, and when a Resource is put
//                         back, the earliest acquired Handle is given priority. This
//                         ensures that earlier started segments finish more quickly
//                         keeping overall resource usage low.
//
// The SegmentUploader simply acquires a Handle from the scheduler, and for each piece
// acquires a Resource from the Handle, launches a goroutine that attempts to upload
// a piece and returns the Resource when it is done, and returns a type that knows how
// to wait for all of those goroutines to finish and return the upload results.
