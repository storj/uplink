// PiecesProgress is an interesting concurrency primitive we don't know what
// to call, but it's kind of like those old clocks that employees would clock
// in and out of. Imagine that Looney Toons episode where Sam the Sheepdog and
// Wile E Coyote are clocking in and out.
//
// In our case, PiecesProgress is two dimensional:
//   - There is the neededShares vs total dimension - this is the number of shares
//     that are necessary for Reed Solomon construction, for instance.
//   - There is the current watermark of what stripe specific pieces are working
//     on.
//
// A bunch of piece readers will be keeping PiecesProgress updated with how
// many shares they have downloaded within their piece. When a piece reader
// tells PiecesProgress that they have downloaded n shares, and that was the
// trigger that means we now have the neededShares necessary shares at a certain
// watermark or stripe, PiecesProgress will tell the piece reader to wake
// up the combining layer.
//
// This data structure is designed to cause these wakeups to happen as little
// as possible.
