Storj is building a decentralized cloud storage network.
[Check out our white paper for more info!](https://storj.io/whitepaper)

----

Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that
allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are
encrypted, broken into little pieces and stored in a global decentralized
network of computers. Luckily, we also support allowing you (and only you) to
retrieve those files!

### Installation

```
go get storj.io/uplink
```

### Example

Ready to use example can be found here: [examples/walkthrough/main.go](examples/walkthrough/main.go)

Provided example requires Access Grant as an input parameter. Access Grant can be obtained from Satellite UI. [See our documentation](https://docs.storj.io/dcs/getting-started/quickstart-uplink-cli/uploading-your-first-object/create-first-access-grant).

### A Note about Versioning

Our versioning in this repo is intended to primarily support the expectations of the
[Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) system, so you can expect that
within a major version release, backwards-incompatible changes will be avoided at high
cost.
